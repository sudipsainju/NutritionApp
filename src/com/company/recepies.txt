1 beef roast, Meat
1 package brown gravy mix, Baking
1 package dried Italian salad dressing mix, Condiments
1 package dry ranch dressing mix, Condiments

Roasted asparagus
ingredients:
1 lb asparagus, Produce
1 1/2 tbsp olive oil, Condiments
1/2 tsp kosher salt, Baking
steps:
Preheat oven to 425F.
Cut off the woody bottom part of the asparagus spears and discard.
With a vegetable peeler, peel off the skin on the bottom 2-3 inches of the spears.
Place asparagus on foil-lined baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil.
Sprinkle with salt.
With your hands, roll the asparagus around until they are evenly coated with oil and salt.
Roast for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your stalks and how tender you like them.
They should be tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.
The tips of the spears will get very brown but watch them to prevent burning.
They are great plain, but sometimes I serve them with a light vinaigrette if we need something acidic to balance out our meal.
